#### User Personas 
-Greg is an incoming freshman at XYZ college. He recently moved to XYZ college from ABC town and does not have a form of transportation. Grey knows he will need transportation to travel to and from school. Rather than using Uber/Lyft with random strangers to go from place to place he wants to make friends with people at XYZ college so he can carpool with them from time to time. He wishes there was an easier way to find people who go to XYZ college that are in his area.

-Doug is an adventurous person and loves sharing his experience. Since his friends all hate trips, Doug wants to meet new people and take them along for a journey. He wishes there was an easier way to find people who enjoy trips to the beach, to other cities, etc and that are in his area.

-Maria is a student at UCSD that just finished her fall quarter finals. She wants to go back to her family over winter break in Los Angeles. She figures that taking an Uber or Lyft would be too expensive and dangerous for her. She needs to find a way to carpool with other students that are going back to LA over break as well.

-Billy is a student at UCLA that is going to visit family over spring break. His family lives in San Francisco and he knows that the drive will be long and cost a good amount of gas money. He figures that carpooling with other people that can pitch in gas money and provide him company would allow for a better trip.
