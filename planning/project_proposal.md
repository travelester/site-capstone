# Project Proposal

Pod Members: **Elias Arghand, William Huang, Shayan Sarnevesht**

## Problem Statement

In a world where Uber and Lyft makes automobile rides uncomfortable with random strangers taking you in their car, we want to make it easier for like-minded or similarly-situated people to carpool together in their activities and form new friendships.

## Description

We want people who share the same physical location or other attributes to be able to meet each other through going on excursions together. If someone is driving/traveling to the beach or some other place, we want Travelesterâ„¢ to be the place for people to get together to carpool and form new friendships.

## Expected Features List

User login system/Registration
Maps interface with ability to create events
Rider or driver for event
Add description to and from where, # of people
Adding confirmation


## Related Work

A similar application to this is Uber and Lyft in which people are able to request rides to wherever they please. Our project stands out from these services because it ensures security in which students are registering for the app with their student id and email. Therefore, people using our website know that the people they would be carpooling with are also fellow college students. Furthermore, it also ensures lower rates compared to services such as Uber or Lyft because the students could be carpooling together over long distances.

## Open Questions

How will we implement features for ride-seekers to speak with ride-hosters?  Will it be real time with sockets.io or an email-like architecture?

How will we gain a critical mass?

How will we get users to prove they are part of the organization they claim? (email confirmation, picture of id, etc.)
