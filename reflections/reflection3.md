## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

This week we were able to utilize our Google Jamboard and implementing stretch features onto our project. We especially focused on CSS this week by cleaning up some pages while also adding button animations, hover effects and changing most of the pages to be responsive to any screen size. For better user experience, we created confirmation pop-ups for when a user joins, leaves and deletes a group. 

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

This week we faced an issue of updating a driver's image on the bullentin board if they had changed their image on their profile page. This is an issue with the state, so we are looking for an alternative on how to update/call the state when loading the bulletin board. Another challenge we had this week was implementing some new features such as a bulletin filter option based on organization and a profile image crop option. Although these features have issues, we want them to work all the time and are actively focusing on resolving these problems before adding more to our plate.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

Yes we were able to finish our tasks in our sprint plan for the week. We were able to finish two additional features that were necessary towards our project before moving on to other stretch features. We completed the feature of allowing the driver to see specific details about riders by clicking on their profile image. We were also able to change most pages to be responsive and usable on any screen size.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

A resource we found helpful this week was our Google Jamboard. We were able to organize our features by to-do, in progress, and done while keepign each other updated on what we were working on individually. 

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

As mentioned in our previous reflection, we feel our live chat feature for a group to be at risk. This live chat feature is not our highest priority as we have other core/nice to have features we are still working on. We can consider cutting this feature if it continues to be at risk, but still hope to implement when our core features and nice-to-haves are completed.
