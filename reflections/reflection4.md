## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 A huge success from this week was being able to tie up a lot of the css issues being dealt with in terms of image sizes by being able to utilize a static size for the profile picture of users. Furthermore, we were able to utilize Material-UI componenets, allowing for a cohesive theme throughout the web app.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 Some challenges we faced this week were dealing with permissions on who can edit rides or delete rides. We were able to figure out the backend logic to prevent any of the riders from editing the rides, but we now need to make sure the buttons do not show up for people who are not drivers of the rides. Some other issues we dealt with were states not refreshing when changes were made to specific events.
 
* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We completed all of our tasks in this sprint plan and were able to get some stretch features out for this week, including deleting accounts and responsiveness on every page on the application. We also were able to fix a lot of the functionality and css bugs throughout the application.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

The resources provided on deploying on heroku and surge from codepath helped us deploy a functioning frontend and backend along with the databse.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 Currently, the last stretch feature that can be added into our app would be the live chat feature. Since it was not our highest priority, we did not draw any attention towards it, but now that we have extra time, we are revisiting this idea and are likely going to try implementing this feature in the final iteration of the application.
