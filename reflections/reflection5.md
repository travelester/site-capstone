## Reflection Questions

* How was the pacing of the capstone project? (i.e too slow, just right, too fast) 
###### The pacing felt just about right for our capacities: we added a few major features each week, and iterated in this fasion until we had a product we felt could adequately meet any of our users' needs.

* To what extent did your plan change over the course of development? Knowing that you know now, what would you do differently if you were starting over?
###### Our plan was mostly condusive to how the project eventually turned out. One exception or thing I would change is that we shouldn't have included in the user stories that we would include a live chat because that reqiured a very specialized skill set with web netowrking protocols like WebRTC and we evenetually realized it wasn't at all necessary for the overall function of the project because we had a contact info section on the profile component for each member of the group.

* How helpful were the labs and weekly assignments in preparing you to create a capstone project? Be specific, what topics do you still have questions about that may or may not have been covered?
###### The labs and weekly asisgnemnts were helpful for sure. Mainly the life tracker assignment was critical since it showed how to use JWT's, React Router, overall layout of an api client, how to create the file structures for the frontend repo, backend repo, how to abstract the database connection from Node to Postgres, etc. That project was very comprehensive and obviously was built upon everything we learned the previous weeks.


* When planning for the capstone project, which resources were the most helpful? (i.e mentors, instructors & TAs, ideation process, pod syncs, wireframes, sprint planning, bug bash, practice demo day, etc.)
